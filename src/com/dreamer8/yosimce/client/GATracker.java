	 * Constructs and sends the social tracking call to the Google Analytics Tracking Code. 
	 * Use this to record clicks on social sharing buttons on your website other than the Google +1 button 
	 * (for which reporting is pre-configured).
	 * 
	 * @param network		-	The network on which the action occurs (e.g. Facebook, Twitter)
	 * @param socialAction	-	The type of action that happens (e.g. Like, Send, Tweet).
	 * @param opt_target	-	Optional. The text value that indicates the subject of the action; 
	 * 							most typically this is a URL target. If undefined, defaults to document.location.href. 
	 * 							For example, if a user clicks the Facebook Like button for a news article, 
	 * 							the URL for that news article could be sent as the string. 
	 * 							You could also supply any other ID identifying the target, such as an ID from 
	 * 							your content management system. As another example, a user could click the Like 
	 * 							button next to a blog post, in which case no value need be sent for this 
	 * 							parameter because the current document location URL is sent by default.
	 * @param opt_pagePath	-	Optional. The page (by path, not full URL) from which the action occurred. 
	 * 							If undefined, defaults to document.location.pathname plus document.location.search. 
	 * 							You will only need to supply a value for this string if you use virtual 
	 * 							(or custom) page paths for Analytic reporting purposes. When using this 
	 * 							option, use a beginning slash (/) to indicate the page URL.
